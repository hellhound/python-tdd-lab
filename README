Small TDD Lab using Python.

1. Create a virtualenv environment and run it.
2. Use this command to install all the dependencies: pip install -r requirements
3. Use nose (using nosetests script with the --exe option because one of the
   test module is an executable file) to run the tests.
4. Have fun!
